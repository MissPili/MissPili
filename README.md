- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MissPili

I am a mathematician with further academic background spanning philosophy of science and history of science.

I received my master's degree in Philosophy of Science and completed my PhD in History of Science at UNAM, MÃ©xico. 

In addition to my research interests, I have 13 years of experience teaching university-level mathematics, statistics, and scientific theory courses.
